# vue-announcer

Imagine browsing pages (routes), receiving alerts and notifications, having a countdown timer on the page, a progress bar or a loading, among others. Now imagine all this happening to people who have visual disabilities and who use screen readers.

The idea of this plugin is to tell the screen reader what is happening and primarily if you use single-page application.  
Inspired by others in the community like:  
https://haltersweb.github.io/Accessibility/spa.html *(Example of how creating an accessible single-page application)*

## Install package
#### NPM
```shell
npm install -S vue-announcer
```

#### Yarn
```shell
yarn add vue-announcer
```
---

## How to use
In your `main.js`
```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueAnnouncer from 'vue-announcer'

Vue.use(VueAnnouncer)
```

In your `App.vue`
Example using `vue-toasted`
```vue
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <vue-announcer />

    <h2>App page</h2>
    
    <button type="button" data-va="toasted" @click="notify">
      trigger notification
    </button>
  </div>
</template>
<script>
export default {
  name: 'app'
  methods: {
    notify () {
      let message = `Hi, it's a toasted notification`
      this.$toasted.success(message)
      this.$announcer.set(message) // Sets the message that will be read by the screen reader automatically.
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

## Announce route changes
For page changes (routes) to be announced automatically, you only need to pass the router object as a parameter at the time of installation.

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import router from './router'
import VueAnnouncer from 'vue-announcer'

Vue.use(VueAnnouncer, {}, router) 
```

### Options
Key                | Data Type  | default      |
------------------ | ---------- | ------------ |
`complementRoute`  | String     | `has loaded` |


Example:
```javascript
Vue.use(VueAnnouncer, {
  complementRoute: 'ha cargado' // e.g. in spanish
}, router) 
```

### Custom message to each page (optional)
You can set a property on the meta object, which will serve as information to get the message that will be announced to the screen reader on each page. e.g.:
```javascript
{
  name: 'home',
  path: '/',
  component: Home,
  meta: {
    announcer: 'Página de inicio'
  }
}
```

When the page loads, the screen reader user will hear:
```shell
Página de inicio ha cargado
```



**Note:**
- The plugin checks whether it was defined in the meta object, otherwise, without any problems, the title of the page being loaded will be used.
- The vue-announcer uses the global after hooks `router.afterEach` to announce the route changes.
